# Multimodal-AI-Towards-Deterministic-Verification-Layers-for-Large-Language-Models
This white paper introduces the Deterministic Verification Layer (DVL) â€” a symbolic, rule-based framework that brings verifiable reasoning to Large Language Models. While LLMs predict likely words, DVL computes, validates, and explains each claim before narration, enabling trustworthy multimodal AI.
